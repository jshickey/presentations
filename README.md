OJUG: [Groovy After All These Years](https://youtu.be/qlWm384x_qQ)

In 2005, a team at Mutual of Omaha selected Groovy for building a mission critical group insurance pricing engine. At the time, this was one of the largest commercial uses of Groovy. Jim McGill, an architect at Mutual of Omaha, will discuss with Scott Hickey, the technical lead on the project, why Groovy was selected, what the concerns were at the time and how Groovy has been instrumental in the continued success of this project.
